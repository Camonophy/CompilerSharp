# CompilerSharp

## General
This program is developed with the intention of visualising the process of translating one programming language (usually a _higher_ one) into another programming language (usually a _lower_ one) by a compiler.
The goal of this project is provide a tool for students in the course "Compilerbau". It is designed to give them a general idea of what actually happens with their code and to convey a better comprehension of compiler messages.

## Status
*This project is in a very early state and is far from finished. Just a few features are implemented yet and only available for a plain self-made pseudo assembler language. Updates will unroll about every two weeks, but without guarantee.* 
No papers are written so far, as the project has just started a few days ago and can go under drastic changes any time.

## Decription
The easiest way to run this program is to bind the Project Solution (.sln) together with all files into a <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/de/downloads/">Visual Studio</a> project. This will stay the best practice for a long time (maybe even until the project ist finished).
